    "description": "Lavender is a perfect addition to Victorian spring gardens thanks to its fragrance, drought tolerance, and pollinator-friendly nature. Choose a sunny location with well-draining, slightly alkaline soil (pH 6.5–8.0). Heavy clay soils should be amended with sand or gravel to improve drainage. Plant in early to mid-spring once the risk of frost has passed. Space each plant around 30–45 cm apart to allow airflow and reduce the chance of fungal issues. Water young plants regularly until established, then reduce watering—lavender thrives on neglect. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers; instead, use a slow-release general-purpose type sparingly. Prune after flowering to maintain a compact shape and encourage bushier growth. Lavender not only adds beauty and scent to your garden, but it also deters pests and attracts bees, making it a great companion for vegetables and fruit trees. With minimal care, it will bloom generously throughout spring and summer.",

Choose a position with full sun—ideally 6 hours or more of direct sunlight daily—and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Before planting, dig compost or aged manure into the soil to support healthy root development. Plant roses at the same depth they were in their nursery pot, and space them 60–90 cm apart to promote air circulation and reduce disease. Water deeply once or twice a week, especially during dry spells, keeping water at the base to avoid fungal issues. Apply mulch to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.

Spring is the best time to plant, giving roots time to settle before the dry summer. Once established, grevilleas are drought-tolerant and only need occasional watering. Apply a thick layer of mulch to conserve soil moisture, but keep it away from the stem base. Prune lightly after flowering to maintain a neat shape and stimulate new growth. Grevilleas are loved by nectar-feeding birds, especially honeyeaters, making them excellent for wildlife-friendly gardens.

Winter planting gives thyme time to develop a strong root system before spring. Choose a sunny spot and avoid heavy clay\u2014raised beds or sandy soils are ideal. Once established, thyme is drought-tolerant and needs only occasional watering. Avoid overwatering, especially during wet winters, to prevent root rot. Prune lightly after flowering to maintain a compact shape. Thyme is perfect for rock gardens, borders, or even between stepping stones thanks to its creeping habit and fragrant leaves. It\u2019s also an excellent companion plant for vegetables, deterring pests like cabbage moths. Mulch with gravel or light straw to insulate roots during frosty nights. This aromatic herb adds flavor to winter stews and roasts, and its evergreen nature brings life to your winter garden.",

    "description": "Palm trees are iconic tropical features that grow well in Queensland\u2019s mild winter climate. Winter is an ideal time to plant as temperatures are cooler and rainfall is more consistent, helping roots establish before the intense summer heat. Choose a sunny or partly shaded spot with free-draining soil. Most palms prefer slightly acidic, sandy or loamy soils, and benefit from organic matter like compost. Water regularly during establishment, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged. Once established, many palm species are drought-tolerant. Mulch around the base to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Use a slow-release palm-specific fertiliser in spring to support healthy foliage. Remove dead fronds as needed, but avoid heavy pruning. Popular varieties for Queensland include Golden Cane, Bangalow, and Foxtail palms. Their upright structure, lush fronds, and minimal maintenance needs make palms perfect for tropical-style gardens, creating year-round greenery even in the winter months.",

    "description": "French Lavender (Lavandula dentata) is a hardy, fragrant shrub that suits South Australia\u2019s dry autumns and is ideal for Mediterranean-style gardens. Plant in full sun with well-draining, slightly alkaline soil\u2014avoid clay-heavy or soggy locations. Autumn planting gives lavender time to establish before summer. Space plants about 60 cm apart to ensure airflow, which helps prevent fungal issues. Water young plants regularly, but once established, lavender becomes drought-tolerant and needs minimal watering. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilisers\u2014use a low-phosphorus mix in spring if needed. Prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. French lavender blooms for long periods and its grey-green foliage adds year-round appeal. It\u2019s great for borders, hedges, pots, and bee-friendly gardens. With its beautiful flowers and calming scent, French lavender is both ornamental and practical\u2014an ideal choice for low-maintenance autumn planting in South Australia.",

    "description": "Oregano is a tough, aromatic herb that thrives in South Australia\u2019s dry, mild autumns. Plant in full sun in well-drained, slightly alkaline soil. Autumn planting gives oregano a chance to develop strong roots before winter dormancy. Space plants 20\u201330 cm apart and water regularly during establishment. Once mature, oregano is drought-tolerant and rarely needs feeding\u2014too much fertiliser can reduce flavour intensity. Oregano grows well in garden beds or pots and benefits from occasional trimming to encourage bushy growth. Harvest leaves as needed, ideally before flowering, for the best flavour. It pairs beautifully with tomatoes, meats, and Mediterranean dishes. In cooler parts of South Australia, oregano may die back in winter but will regrow in spring. Mulch lightly to protect the roots from cold snaps. With its rich aroma, culinary versatility, and easy care, oregano is a perfect autumn addition to productive or ornamental backyard gardens.",

    "description": "Westringia, or Native Rosemary, is a hardy Australian shrub perfectly suited to South Australia\u2019s cool, dry winters. It thrives in full sun to part shade and tolerates a wide range of soil types, including poor or sandy soils, provided they drain well. Plant in winter to allow roots to establish before summer. Water regularly during the first year, then reduce as it becomes drought-tolerant. Prune lightly after flowering to encourage dense growth and maintain a neat, rounded shape. Westringia produces pale lilac to white flowers throughout much of the year, especially in winter and spring, and attracts pollinators like bees. It works beautifully as a low-maintenance hedge, border, or native feature plant. Westringia requires very little fertiliser\u2014apply a low-phosphorus native mix in spring if needed. With its resilience, tidy form, and soft flowers, it\u2019s an excellent choice for winter planting in South Australia\u2019s coastal and inland gardens.",

It prefers full sun but tolerates partial shade and grows best in fertile, well-drained soil enriched with compost or aged manure. Sow seeds or plant seedlings 30\u201340 cm apart in rows spaced 50 cm apart. Water regularly to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry winter periods. Mulch to reduce weeds and retain moisture. Feed fortnightly with a liquid seaweed or organic fertiliser to promote leafy growth. Kale is cold-hardy and sweeter after light frosts, making winter the perfect time to grow it. Harvest outer leaves when they\u2019re around 15\u201320 cm long, leaving the centre to keep producing. Remove yellowing or damaged leaves to maintain plant health. Ideal for salads, soups, and stir-fries, kale is easy to grow and highly productive through the cooler months in South Australian gardens.",
